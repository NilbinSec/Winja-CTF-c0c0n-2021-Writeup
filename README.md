Nilbin_Sec is a recently formed hacker group formed out of some of the hardcore fans of Nathan Barnatt's Pseudo-Alternate Reality Game character Dad. Currently we focus our pursuits on OSINT, cryptography, web exploitation, and custom hardware hacking. We can be reached at: nilbinsec (at) gmail (dot) com.
